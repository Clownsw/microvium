# MicroVM

A compact, embeddable scripting engine for microcontrollers for executing small scripts written in a subset of JavaScript.

(The name "MicroVM" is tentative)

**Note: THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT**

## Features

  - Run the same script code on small microcontrollers and desktop-class machines (ideal for IoT applications with shared logic between device and server)
  - Persist the state of a virtual machine to a database or file**
  - Run the scripts on your custom host API for your particular application
  - Lightweight and portable MCU implementation
  - Easy to use

**There is a separate implementation of the virtual machine for microcontrollers vs desktop-class machines, which support different features. Check out the [Concepts](./doc/concepts.md) page for more detail.
