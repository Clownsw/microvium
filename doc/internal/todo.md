# To Do

(Keeping this list short, so it's useful. Not a wishlist of things I want to do in the medium and long term)

  - Finish off the "getting started" documentation
  - Fix the seg fault when global variables are marked reachable
  - Sort out ownership, anchors, weakrefs, etc.
  - Module objects and importing
