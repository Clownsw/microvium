# To do

WIP: I've temporarily disabled my pre-commit hook while everything is broken in the closures branch

## Important

  - Closures
  - Classes
  - Debugger
  - Dynamic stack size
  - Exceptions
  - Job loop?
  - Add a hash ID to the bytecode file and make a way to create a crash dump to diagnose errors

## Nice to have

  - Start integrating test262
  - Promises
  - Async-await
  - Handled-promise
  - Top-level await
  - Variadic calls
  - Symbol type
  - Virtual types and BigInt
  - RegExp
  - Proxy
  - The rest of the builtins, e.g. Date, Map, Set, etc.
